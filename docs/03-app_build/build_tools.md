### GNU Autotools

* GNU Build System: `./configure && make && make install`
* [Autotools Tutorial](https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html)

* [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts to automatically configure software source code packages

* Automake

* [GNU libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) is a generic library support script. Libtool hides the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable interface.

* Gettext


### CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software

* [Awesome CMake](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake): A curated list of awesome CMake resources, scripts, modules, examples and others.

* [ccmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/ccmake.1.html) is the **CMake curses interface**

## Ninja

[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) is a small build system with **a focus on speed**. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.


## Bazel

[Bazel](https://bazel.build/): a fast, scalable, multi-language and extensible build system


## Meson

[Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/) is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.


## SCons: A software construction tool

[SCons](https://scons.org/) is an Open Source software construction tool — that is, a next-generation build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the classic Make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way to build software.


## Apache Ant

[Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets and tasks.

## Gradle

From mobile apps to microservices, from small startups to big enterprises, [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) helps teams build, automate and deliver better software, faster.
