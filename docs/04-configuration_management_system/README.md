### wstool

[wstool](https://www.mankier.com/1/wstool) is a command to manipulate multiple version controlled folders, using it you can update several folders using **a variety SCMs (SVN, Mercurial, git, Bazaar)** with just one command

### vcstool

[Vcstool](http://wiki.ros.org/vcstool) is a version control system (VCS) tool, designed to make working with multiple repositories easier.

vcstool provides commands to manage several local SCM repositories (supports git, mercurial, subversion, bazaar) based on a single workspace definition file (.repos or .rosinstall).

vcstool replaces wstool. In contrast to wstool it doesn't have any state beside the working directories of the repositories in the file system.

For compatibility with rosinstall_generator is can read .rosinstall files. The file format of .repos files generated by vcs export provides stricter guarantees (e.g. that all entries are collision free when fetching them).

### rosinstall

Using [rosinstall](http://wiki.ros.org/rosinstall) you can update several folders using a variety of SCMs (SVN, Mercurial, git, Bazaar) with just one command.

### Git
